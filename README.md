# Specification of Metarhia Distributed Infrastructure

Templates and tasks of the technological stack of an extensible and configurable multifunctional distributed system. Such a system can be useful as a foundation for a wide class of tasks: education, health care, industry, ecommercce, social interactions, etc.

The goal of such a system is to provide out of the box a uniform, simple, efficient and cheap mechanism for systems with unpredictable user growth and associated traffic fluctuations. The maximum versatility of such a system will make it possible to reuse its customizable modules with minimal effort and in minimal time. Ideally, the modules of the system should resemble the elements of the LEGO set, with the described standard connection methods and the variability of the assembly results.

Not everything in this specification is in line with the current state of the art in the technology stack right now. Here
described how it should be. For the latest information, see
